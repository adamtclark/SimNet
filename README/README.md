# SimNet

A collection of models meant to study relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning. Each model contains a folder in the "README" and "src" sections, which include general information, and raw source code, respectively. Models are formatted such that running the command ./main.* in the corresponding src directory will run the model and produce all standardized outputs.
